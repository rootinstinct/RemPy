# RemPy
Bankrupting visual novel devs with terrible AI prompts that absolutely nobody asked for.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 (?)
- Ren'Py 8.1.1 (?)

## Installation Instructions
Download game to Ren'Py projects folder (whichever that is for you) and run through Ren'Py application.

Obviously, it won't work without the personal token from `c.ai`, so in order to do literally anything with the game, you will have to find and paste your personal token. This can be done by going to the website itself, pressing `Ctrl + Shift + J`, going to Local Storage and finding the key that starts with an `@`.

`THE JOKE IS, THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT YET (SOONâ„¢)`
